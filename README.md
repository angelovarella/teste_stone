# Stone Data Scientist Challenge

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to solving the data science challenge presented by Stone for the Data Scientist role.

The project folders are structured as follows:

- Functions: contains all the custom functions used in the challenge.
- Notebooks: includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, testing, and model development.
- Outputs: stores all generated output files.
- Test Data: holds the provided dataset and instructions for this test.

## Installations

To replicate this project, ensure you have the following Python modules installed:

```python
pip install pandas
pip install python-dotenv
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install statsmodels
```

## MLOps

Refer to mlops.md for the proposed MLOps process. Note that this project serves as an illustration, and there are notable differences compared to a production environment. For instance, while notebooks are useful for exploration, production-ready models should be integrated using scripts, and containerization or virtual environments should be employed. A great resource for this transition is provided [here](https://marvelousmlops.substack.com/p/bridging-the-gap-converting-data).
