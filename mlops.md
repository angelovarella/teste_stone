# MLOps for predction model

Continuous improvement of a prediction model involves an iterative process aimed at enhancing the model's accuracy, robustness, and relevance over time. Hereâ€™s a proposed structured approach to achieving this.

## Step-by-step plan

The implement_process.jpeg file has a Miro illustration of this proposed implementation process in detail.

### 1. Performance Metrics

Establishing clear metrics to measure the performance of a prediction model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) is an important first step. These metrics will serve as benchmarks for improvement.

Key metrics to use in testing:

- R-squared
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Coefficient signals and p-values

Other metrics based on the confusion matrix and real-time input data should be monitored continuously. For this, outputs like .describe() and other relevant methods are valuable.

### 2. Data Collection and Updates

For continuous implementation, the pipeline must regularly collect relevant data to ensure the model remains current and effective. It's important to:

- Update the existing dataset to include the latest information and address issues like data drift
- Conduct automated tests to ensure data integrity and quality to maintain the relevance of the model

### 3. Data Processing

Once the data is properly collected and analyzed for integrity and quality, it's important to process it in an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. This involves:

- Cleaning and structuring the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
- Performing feature engineering to extract meaningful features that can improve model performance

### 4. Model Evaluation

Continuous automatic evaluation is crucial for ongoing development. Monitoring data quality and prediction metrics is essential.

After evaluation, it's important to have an action plan in case of new behavior in predictions. With that in mind, it's advisable to:

- Assess the current performance of your prediction model using defined metrics on new or updated data
- Identify areas of improvement based on the model's strengths and weaknesses
- Perform tests like [SHAP](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability) and establish rules for [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html) outcomes
- Maintain a baseline and use other comparison methods to better understand prediction performance
- Train updated models on revised datasets, incorporating new data and insights gained from previous iterations
- Validate model performance using a hold-out dataset or through cross-validation to avoid overfitting
- Conduct other integrity tests for the chosen model to ensure relevance and performance

### 5. Experimentation

Maintaining a team focused on research for improvement is helpful. This not only keeps the model up-to-date with the state-of-the-art but also enables continuous improvement. This includes:

- Experimenting with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature selections to enhance model performance
- Utilizing techniques like cross-validation to assess model stability and generalizability
- Establishing new baselines and performance rules

### 6. Model Deployment

For CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), it's important to adhere to established processes and maintain alignment with the original plan. Considerations include:

- Environment setup and containers
- Version control using Git
- Integration and unit testing
- Performance monitoring
- Data drift detection and threshold alerts
- Error handling and logging
- Continuous validation
- Feedback mechanism
- Plan for major model updates and rollbacks
- Deployment in controlled environments
- Documentation and communication

### 7. Feedback Loop

Improvements depend on feedback. It's important to maintain a constant evaluation process by:

- Gathering feedback from model users, stakeholders, and domain experts to understand practical challenges and opportunities for improvement
- Incorporating this feedback into future iterations of the prediction model

### 8. Automatic Re-training and Updating

After completing an ML cycle, develop a set of tools that automate the updating process:

- Establish a schedule or trigger mechanism to retrain the model periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) with new data
- Automate the re-training process as much as possible to ensure efficiency and consistency
- Continuously iterate through the above steps, integrating new data, insights, and techniques to refine the prediction model over time
- Foster collaboration between data scientists, domain experts, and stakeholders to drive meaningful improvements

### 9. Documentation and Reporting

Finally, long-term projects require organization and documentation to enable collaboration and learning from the process. It's helpful to:

- Maintain detailed documentation of model versions, changes, and performance metrics
- Regularly report on model improvements, challenges, and future directions to stakeholders

## Conclusion

By following this structured process, it's possible to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and applicability of any prediction model to better support decision-making and business outcomes.
